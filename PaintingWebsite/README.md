# How to run
1. (Optional but highly recommended) Open a terminal window and create a new virtual environment inside of the folder this README.md file is in like so:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
```
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in terminal (this installs all the necessary packages)
3. In terminal, run `cd PaintingWebsite`
4. After that has completed, run `python manage.py runserver`
5. Open a browser and go to the address that shows up in the terminal window after completing step 6 (should be http://127.0.0.1:8000/):
```
Starting development server at [address]
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
```
